[API reference](https://nimdocs.com/treeform/webby)

Webby is a collection of common HTTP data structures and functionality. This includes things like `HttpHeaders`, `QueryParams` etc.

You probably won't be importing this directly. Instead, it will come along as a dependency for another library you are using.

Some libraries using Webby include [Mummy](https://github.com/guzba/mummy) and [Puppy](https://github.com/treeform/puppy).
